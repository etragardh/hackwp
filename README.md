# hackwp

This is a work in progress. It is not ready yet.
The main idea is to create a tool that combines the best from `wpscan` and `msf` to be used by pentesters, webmasters and sysadmins to test their own sites, equipment and infrastructure.

I will create both exploits and payloads as I see fit but it would be very much appreciated if the community would help with that.
