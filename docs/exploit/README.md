# Exploit
## How to create an exploit


### RCE
Exploits that supports RCE needs to take php as input.

PHP input is the full php code with opening and closing tags as needed.

```
<?php echo "test"; ?>
<?php echo 'test'; ?>
```

Should both be accepted inputs.
The return should be the entire raw output.

### SQLi
Exploits that supports SQLi should take SQL syntax as input and output the results like this

STATUS: <bool>
AFFECTED ROWS: <int>
INSERT ID: <int>
ERROR: <string>
